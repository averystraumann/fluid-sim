fluid simulator using processing!

reference: https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html

a fluid simulation made using mike ash's guide, but changed to two dimensions. this sim is based on the navier-stokes equations for fluid dynamics :)

by dragging your mouse around, you add "dye" into the fluid environment, which has a different density of the base fluid. this interacts with the rest of the fluid, demonstrating diffusion, advection, and projection. i recommend reading the linked paper to understand these more!!

there is a video demo in this repository, but to try it yourself, make sure you have processing installed, and then you can download the source code and run it!
